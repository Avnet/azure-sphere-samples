# Sample: Avnet Azure Sphere Default Project

This sample project was developed by Avnet to provide a fully functional extendable Azure Sphere application that can easily be modified for your custom application.  The application was built using the Microsoft AzureIoT example as a starting point.  The implementation includes a high level application and multiple pre-build AzureRTOS real time applications that can be leveraged.

See the README.md files in the HighLevelExampleApp and RealTimeExampleApp directories for more details.
