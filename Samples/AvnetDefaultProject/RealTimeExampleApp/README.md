# Real time applications

The pre-built applications in this directory were build from sources located [here](https://github.com/Avnet/avnet-azure-sphere-AzureRTOS).  Please see the <applicationName>.md files for each imagepackage file to learn about each application, its interfaces and how to include them into a high level application.  

Each of these example applications can be included in the AvnetDefaultProject/HighLevelExampleApp by reviewing the /common/build_options.h file and uncommenting the #defines that correspond with each real time application.
